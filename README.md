# GENAL
Genetic Algorithm
Starting to adapt to python. This is my first code.

For the Python files, the objective function(CostFunc) is found in the GAfuncs 
For the Jupyter notebook, the objective function (CostFunc) is found in the GAmain

This function solves the minimum point of the sphere function
y = sum( x^2 )
